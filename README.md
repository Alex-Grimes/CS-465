FullStack-Development


Architecture
Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?

we used both an MPA and SPA for this project the MPA application used handlebars paired with express to make a simple page with minor amounts of data plugged into the page as for the SPA we used angular to create an admin site still useing express and mongoDB for our database NoSQL made sense for this project because it's documents are able to be returned as JSON with minimal effort. 


Functionality
How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.

JSON is javascript object notation but functions nothing like actual javascript it is essentially a way to message back and forth between systems reusable components are amazing they give us the ability to write code once and use it over and over again just like a function but better. we did this with our card components being able to call that component multiple times on the page made the process easy to repeat without being repetitive.

Testing
Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.

security in full stack apps and SPA's, in particular, can tend to be fairly tricky depending on how you are doing your authorization luckily for this project we were routing to "different pages" and we were rendering a completely different view so we could set an authorization requirement on that. in my experience with applications that just render different components on the same page that authorization gets a bit more tricky. 


Reflection
How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?

since I'm already a web developer and tend to work on more complicated real-world projects than this one in particular I don't feel that I necessarily learned anything although I could see how it could be beneficial for someone who has never done any web development.
